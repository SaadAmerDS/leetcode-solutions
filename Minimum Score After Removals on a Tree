Intuition
We are given a tree — that means it's a connected graph with no cycles, and has exactly n - 1 edges.

Our goal is to:

Remove two edges from this tree, which will split it into three connected components.

For each component, compute the XOR of all the node values inside it.

Return the minimum possible difference between the largest and smallest XOR values of the three components.

Approach
We are given a tree and asked to remove two edges to form three components. We want the minimum difference between the max and min XOR of values in those components.

Steps:

Build the tree from edges using adjacency list.

Run DFS from root node to:

Compute subtree_xor of each node.

Save in_time and out_time to check ancestor-descendant relationships.

Try all combinations of two edge removals.

For each edge pair, use ancestor logic to determine component separation.

Compute XOR values of the resulting three components.

Return the minimum difference of max and min XOR among components.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(N^2) — We check all pairs of edges (max 1000 × 1000 = 1e6)

Space complexity:
O(N) — For each node, we compute subtree XOR once via DFS

        min_score = float('inf')

        # Step 3: try all edge pairs (n ≤ 10^4 so ~50M loops is okay now)

            for j in range(i+1, len(edge_list)):
                _, u = edge_list[i]
                _, v = edge_list[j]
